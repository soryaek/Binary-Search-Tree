# Binary-Search-Tree
This program allows user to enter input numbers as string and then store them as integer values by using ParseInt(). After the user is done entering numbers, it will print out the values in three different types of traversals such as pre-order, in-order, and post-order. After the traversals are printed, the user has a few options from a menu to choose with whether he/she wants to insert or delete a number. However, user only allows using one method at a time. Recursive was used in this program because it was easy to keep asking user what to do next within this program. So once new value is added or deleted to/from the tree, a new tree is generated and it will print in in-order traversal. In addition, this program can perform predecessor and successor.
